## Introduction

After using [copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) to share my files with other devices (refer to [copyparty](https://github.com/1995parham-me/copyparty) repository to see the detail intorduction),
I found out it is not good enough and well supported to other devices as [Samba](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Samba) protocol.

## How to use?

First you need to install and configure Samba, I have a script for it:

```bash
./start.sh
```
